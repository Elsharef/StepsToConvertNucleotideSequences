Purpose: I was having trouble remembering how to go back and forth between RNA and DNA in different directions. Even though there were some more complex converters already online, I found that the steps to manually converting stuck better when I chose to code it out. 
Possible improvements/additions:
 *         adding in a GUI
 *         having a self test option where the user creates the comp strand/opp
 *         figuring out a more efficient algorithm for changing the input
 *         making it easier to enter a 5' to 3' strand
 *         including more jUnitTests
